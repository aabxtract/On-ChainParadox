# **App Name**: On-Chain Paradox Machine

## Core Features:

- Paradox Submission: Users submit logical paradoxes via a text input, initiating the minting of a Paradox NFT.
- Paradox NFT Minting: On submission, mint a unique Paradox NFT (ERC-721) storing the paradox text, creator address, and creation timestamp on-chain.
- Dynamic State Field: NFT metadata includes a 'state' field (Solvable, Unsure, Impossible) that evolves based on community voting.
- Community Voting: Wallet users vote on each paradox (Solvable, Unsure, Impossible), with votes stored on-chain.
- Dynamic NFT Evolution: NFT metadata evolves to reflect consensus: Solvable (bright, geometric), Unsure (glitchy symbol), Impossible (dark fractal).  Use the concept of a 'consensus shift' to trigger this change.
- Logic Warp Oracle: Leverage an AI tool to periodically assess paradoxes marked 'Unsure', providing probabilistic analysis towards Solvable or Impossible based on current information. This provides extra support for consensus building and might affect NFT evolution.
- Impossibility Index Display: Display voting results on the frontend as an 'Impossibility Index', with smooth updates and animations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric purple (#BE29EC) for a cosmic and futuristic feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) for sleekness and contrast.
- Accent color: Neon green (#39FF14) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a computerized, techy, scientific feel, for both headlines and short amounts of body text.
- Use minimalist, neon-outlined icons related to paradoxes and logical concepts.
- Employ a glassmorphism effect with subtle glow and cosmic background particles.
- Incorporate smooth micro-animations, fade-ins, and typewriter text effects for displaying paradoxes.
